// MARK: - Vp8Tuning
//
// MTS Link carries `vp8channel` alone, and the core's release gate measures it
// at about 15 Mbit/s down with `vp8: { fps: 60, batch_size: 64 }`. A frame
// leaves every 1/fps seconds carrying up to `batch_size` packets, so the
// ceiling scales roughly with the frame rate — the 30 / 64 the settings default
// to leaves half of it unused. Whenever an MTS Link room is involved the
// effective numbers are therefore 60 and at least 64; every other protocol
// keeps the person's numbers untouched.
//
// One rule, used by the server configs an MTS Link room is written into
// (SSHRunner.installEnv / addCarrierEnv / reconfigureScript) and by the phone's
// engine start (OlcrtcEngine, the VPN configuration).
