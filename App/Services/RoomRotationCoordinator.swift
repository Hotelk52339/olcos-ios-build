// and TelemostRenewalCoordinator renews them on that clock under its own
// Automatic rule. WB Stream offers no schedule while the service is closed to
// regular accounts (CarrierAvailability).

// TelemostRenewalCoordinator and owned the same way (built by AppServices,
// held by MainTabView): rotation has to keep working while the user is
// anywhere in the app, and it holds its OWN Provisioner so an unattended
// rotation cannot race a screen-driven operation for one SSH lane.
//
// Nothing about DELIVERING a room is reinvented here. A rotated room is
// applied through `Provisioner.reconfigure` — the same SSH path a manual
// room change takes — confirmed against the URI the server prints back
// (`TelemostRenewalCoordinator.confirms`), and the record is corrected in
// place exactly the way a renewal corrects it. The room-creation date rides
// the same `roomCreatedAt` field the Telemost clock uses. Each protocol brings
// its own room creator; everything after the creation is shared.
//
// There is no local-notification framework in this app (and adopting one
// means a new permission nobody asked for), so outcomes surface the way the
// Telemost renewal's do: LogStore lines, plus the honest state of the
// Accounts screen — a session the daily check has watched the service refuse
// is unlinked, so "signed in" stops being a claim the app cannot back.
