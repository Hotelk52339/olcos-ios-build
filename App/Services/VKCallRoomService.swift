// MARK: - VKCallRoomService
//
// One button's worth of API: create a fresh VK call from the phone, with the
// user's OWN VK account.
//
// Why the phone and not the VPS
// -----------------------------
// The same reason as TelemostRoomService: a room minted by the server is a room
// the phone can never learn again during a whitelist window. The phone creates
// the call and hands the link down the SSH path.
//
// The request chain
// -----------------
// VK's web client keeps its session in the `remixsid` cookie, but the method
// API (`api.vk.ru/method/*`) takes an OAuth-style bearer token. The chain the
// web client itself runs — and the one `kulikov0/whitelist-bypass` uses — is:
//
//   1. `login.vk.ru/?act=web_token` with the cookies — the WHOLE vk.ru jar
//      the browser holds, not `remixsid` alone (VKSessionStore) — hands back
//      `{"type":"okay","data":{"access_token":"…","user_id":…}}` — the token
//      of THIS session. Its refusals are the SAME envelope with
//      `type:"error"` and an `error_info` ("unauthorized" for a missing or
//      stale/GUEST session; "wrong origin" when the Origin header is not
//      exactly https://vk.ru).
//   2. `calls.start` mints the call — with NO `peer_id`: the production
//      reference (whitelist-bypass's vk-bot and Electron creator) launches it
//      parameterless and that is what works. Its `join_link` is a bare ~43
//      char id (never a URL), normalized to `https://vk.ru/call/join/<id>`
//      (`VKCallLink.fromJoinValue`).
//
// Anti-bot: a request without a browser User-Agent is answered HTTP 418 — the
// desktop UA below is load-bearing, not cosmetic.
//
// VK's method API is the web client's own, unofficial, and can change; every
// answer is parsed defensively and an unreadable body is an error, not a
// guessed success.
//
// Isolation: a nonisolated `enum` of statics, like every other stateless service
// here. Log lines hop to MainActor one at a time.
