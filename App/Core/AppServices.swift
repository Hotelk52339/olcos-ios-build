// MARK: - AppServices
//
// The app-wide objects a connection needs, built once per process.
//
// MainTabView used to build them in its own initializer, which runs only when
// a window exists. A widget, the Control Centre toggle or CarPlay can launch
// the app in the BACKGROUND, with no window, to switch the tunnel
// (`TunnelRemoteControl`). Both paths now take the same instances from here,
// so a session started from the Lock Screen is the one the app shows when it
// is opened, and there is never a second TunnelManager in the process.
//
// Views still receive these by initializer (MainTabView wraps them in
// `@StateObject`); nothing in the view tree reads `AppServices.shared`.
