// MARK: - LaneBalancer
//
// Spreads one olcrtc tunnel's connections over several rooms of the same
// carrier ("lanes", OlcrtcConnection.extraRooms). Each lane is its own core
// runtime with its own loopback SOCKS listener. This listens on the port apps
// use and hands every NEW connection to the next lane that is up, byte for
// byte: the SOCKS handshake itself goes through to the lane, so credentials
// work unchanged. A single download still rides one room; a browser, Telegram
// or a speed test open several connections, and the rooms' speeds add up — a
// room's bitrate budget is per room (measured on a VPS: two SaluteJazz rooms
// carried twice what one did).
//
// A lane is skipped while its runtime is not running, and benched for a while
// after it twice in a row returns a connection that died with almost nothing
// sent back: a room that lost its server still accepts SOCKS, but every
// CONNECT through it fails.

/// Which lane takes the next connection. Pure → unit-tested.
