    // is NOT backward-compatible across upstream's #140 overhaul, and there is
    // no version negotiation — a client and server built from different commits
    // fail right after the handshake. The shipped Mobile.xcframework is built
    // from the `olcrtc-upstream` submodule pin, so the server MUST be built from
    // the SAME commit. `scripts/srv.sh` used to `git clone --branch master`,
    // which silently tracked upstream's moving tip and broke every install once
    // master diverged (it also flipped the `data:` config key to a fatal one).
    // This SHA is emitted as `OLCRTC_PIN` by `SSHRunner.installEnv` and pins the
    // server build. Keep it EQUAL to the submodule pin in `.gitmodules` /
    // whatever commit `scripts/build-framework.sh` builds the framework from —
    // bump both together, never one alone.

    // OLC2/HKDF record layer, handshake v3, OLVC v5 frames, instance mobile API)

    // tunnel right after the handshake. Old 42ae4e0 servers MUST be reinstalled.
